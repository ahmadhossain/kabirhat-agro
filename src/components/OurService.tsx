          A Safira Agri was founded with the intention of structuring the corn,
          soy, and agricultural supplies import/export business, searching
          alternative markets for commercializing those products, going where
          the traditional trading companies canâ€™t go: the small quantity
          markets.

        <div>
          Initially, Safira Agri Ltda. was created with the intention of
          draining the production of soy and corn deriving from the cooperatives
          installed in Parana, generating production value, and searching for
          strategic investors to fund the structures of more than 47
          cooperatives and in the purchase of supplies for more than 180
          thousand partners associated with those cooperatives.
        </div>
        <div>
          Our company has a potential production reach of more than 3 million
          tons of soy, and 2 million tons of corn from the 180 thousand
          suppliers associated with the agricultural cooperatives from the state
          of parana in Brazil.
        </div>
        <div>
          Our strong connection with more than 47 local cooperatives in Brazil
          helps us amplify the supply of soy and corn to international partners
          in a short period of time.
